# Reading Assignment 4: Generative Adversarial Networks

This time we will be using the book 
[Probabilistic Machine Learning: Advanced Topics](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book2.html)
by Kevin P. Murphy. Chapter 26 is on GANs. Please read:
- Up to and including section 26.3
  - You can skip the latter parts of 26.2 (f-divergences and following sections)
- 26.6 on neural architectures

The book treats GANs with a lot of "hindsight", embedding them in a broader context
of so-called implicit likelihood models, as well as providing a unified framework
for many different GAN variants. If you want a simpler, more heuristic approach,
consider reading [the original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf). As 
another alternative, you could consider 
[this blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-generative-adversarial-networks-gans-cd6e4651a29).

Finally, [DCGAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf) was the first paper to 
demonstrate successful use of CNNs in GANs. The paper includes many "design principles"
to stabilize GAN training. It's a bit outdated, but can still be useful.
