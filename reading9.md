# Reading Assignment 9: Denoising Diffusion Models

Literature on diffusion models is mathematically complex and usually quite dense.
You have multiple choices to get an overview of how they function, but all of them
are quite rough:

- [The 2020 paper that quickly made them the most popular generative models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11239.pdf)
- [Blog post by Lilian Weng](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2021-07-11-diffusion-models/)
- [Chapter 25 of Murphy's book](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book2.html)
  - The basics are covered in the beginning; sections 25.3 and following can be skipped
- You could even read [the original paper proposing the method in 2015](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/sohl-dickstein15.pdf),
but this is likely less relevant.
